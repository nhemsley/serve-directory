//! `serve-directory` is a simple command line utility to serve static files from the command line. In
//! the general case, we really mean *simple*. To start a web server serving the contents of the current
//! directory and its subdirectories, just run the executable without arguments.
//!
//! ```bash
//! $ serve-directory
//! ```
//!
//! ## Markdown Support
//! When built with the `markdown` feature, `serve-directory` can render Markdown files (`.md` and 
//! `.markdown`) as styled HTML pages instead of serving them as raw text files.
//!
//! ```bash
//! $ cargo build --features markdown
//! ```
//!
//! Files are accessed based on their relative position to the target folder. Consider the following
//! (abbreviated) rust project structure:
//! ```text
//! Project Structure:          Route:
//!  .                          /
//!  ├─ src/                    /src
//!  │  ├─ main.rs              /src/main.rs
//!  │  └─ stuff.rs             /src/stuff.rs
//!  ├─ target/                 /target
//!  │  └─ debug/               /target/debug
//!  │     └─ app.exe           /target/debug/app.exe
//!  └─ README.md               /README.md
//! ```
//!
//! As you can see, the correlation between the file structure and the route is quite natural.
//!
//! ## Why Should I Care?
//! Sometimes, configuring network folders is way more work than it's worth to simply pass a couple
//! files between machines, especially if you're moving files to or from a headless system. While users
//! could use a tool like SFTP, `serve-directory` provides a nice graphical way to browse the filesystem
//! in a web browser that should prove less daunting for new users. It also allows downloading files to
//! multiple clients without having to log in through SSH multiple times.
//!
//! It's also easy and doesn't require any additional setup (provided the user has a compiled
//! executable). Most users already have a browser on their machine. And, in the event that the user
//! does not, they can use `curl` or `wget` to download files over HTTP.
//!
//! While it's evident that there's a use case for a simple and erogonomic HTTP file server, why
//! would you use `serve-directory` instead of one of the more established options like the
//! [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) package for NodeJS? I will concede that in many cases,
//! serve will probably suit your needs better. However, because `serve-directory` is written in Rust
//! and natively compiled, it can be used and distributed in a single executable without a runtime.
//! Additionally, with the optional markdown feature, it can render documentation files nicely.
